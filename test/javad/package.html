<TITLE>Javad: class file dump (disassembler)</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

The <i>javad</i> program reads a Java class file and
writes out a Java like source representation of the class that
generated the file.  This kind of program is commonly called a
Java class file disassembler.

<p>
   Regardless of the number of classes in a source file, Java
   compilers that follow Sun's Java scheme will compile one class per
   file.  This program reads the compiled class and dumps it in a
   readable form, akin to Java source.

<h4>
Usage
</h4>

<pre>
java javad.main <i>classfile-list</i>
</pre>
<p>
For example: <tt>java javad.main one.class two.class three.class</tt>

<h4>
Notes
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
u1 : unsigned byte value
</li>
<li>
u2 : unsigned two byte value
</li>
<li>
u4 : unsigned four byte value
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Why was this program written?
</h4>

<p>
I wanted to understand the Java class file format.  This was
critical for my work on my Java compiler, since a Java compiler
must be able to read class symbol information from the .class
file.  The "javad" program was written in Java because I wanted to
write a semi-sizable application in Java to get a feel for Java
class structure versus C++.

<h4>
Prior Art
</h4>

<p>
   A number of Java class file disassemblers have been written.
   One of these is shipped in binary form with the Sun Java release
   (javap).  There are several class file disassemblers available
   in source form.  These include:
 
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Djava
</p>
<p>
Djava is a Java class file disassembler written in C.  This program is
available from a number of sites, including <a
href="http://www.sco.com/skunkware/98/java/">http://www.sco.com/skunkware/98/java/</a>.
The program was written by Shawn Silverman.  Apparently a Java version
of Djava also exists.

<p>
Jasper
</p>
<p>
Jasper is a Java class file disassembler written in Java.  I did not
find this published on a web page.  It was published in a discussion
group on object oriented programming.  The author is Chris Rathman.  I
have no idea if this URL will hold up over time, but I found

<h4>
Disassemblers and decompilers
</h4>

<p> 
As any Java programmer knows, Java does not use header files to
define external classes (e.g., a class that is not in the current
file).  Information about the structure of a class can be obtained
from a .class file.  As the <i>javad</i> and the other class file
disassemblers show, the much of the original source for the class
definition can be recovered from the class file.
</p>

<p>
Compared to machine code (e.g., x86, powerPC, SPARC), Java byte codes are
very high level.  A clever piece of software can recover something
close to the original source code for the methods. These programs are
referred to as decompilers.  For those who want to keep their source
code secret there are Java code obfuscators.

<p>
A list of Java disassemblers and decompilers is published on <a href="http://www.meurrens.org/ip-Links/Java/codeEngineering/decomp.html">Marc
Meurrens home page</a>.

<p>
This page mentions that Hanpeter van Vliet wrote a Java decompiler,
named Mocha.  Apparently the program does a good job of decompiling
Java class files.  When it appeared the first response, presumably of
some United States citizens, was to threaten to sue.  Sanity seems to
have asserted itself and no one sued.  But it spurred the development
of "obfuscators", including van Vliet's own "Crema".  A copy of van
Vliet's "manifesto" can be found <a href="http://www.meurrens.org/ip-Links/Java/codeEngineering/tercentennial.html">here</a>.

<p>
According to this web page, van Vliet died of cancer on December 31,
1996 at age 34, not long after finishing Mocha.  The current Mocha
release can also be found on <a href="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/computers/mocha.html">Eric Smith's web page</a>

<p>
It is interesting to note that at one point Borland/Imprise sent
e-mail to Eric Smith claiming ownership of Mocha.  The despicable
way that some companies treat free software is the motivation for
the Bear Products International source license agreement
used for Javad.

<p>
The European KOPI project has created a Java source to byte code
compiler.  KOPI also includes byte code assemblers and a class file
disassembler.  The KOPI project can be found <a

<p> Marco Schmidt has published a list of Java compilers and Java
VMs.  This list can be found <a
