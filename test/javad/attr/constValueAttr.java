/**

   Represent a ConstantValue attribute.

  <p>
   The JVM Specification (4.7.3) states:

<blockquote>
     The constValueAttr is a fixed length attribute used in the
     "attributes" table of the field info structure.  A constValueAttr
     represents the value of a constant field that must be (explicitly
     or implicitly) static; that is the ACC_STATIC bit in the flags
     item o fthe field_info structure must be set.  The field is not
     required to be final.  There can be no more than one
     constValueAttr attribute in the attributes table of a given field
     info structure.  The constant field represented by the field_info
     structure is assigned the value referenced by its constValueAttr
     attribute as part of its initialization.
</blockquote>

<p>
   Every JVM is required to recognize the constValueAttr.  There
   may be other locally defined attributes which are ignored in
   general but may be used by a specific combination of Java
   compiler and JVM (so much for portability).

<p>
   The constValueAttr is

<pre>
     ConstantValue_attribute {
       u2 attribute_name_index;
       u4 attribute_length;    
       u2 constantvalue_index;
     }
</pre>

<p>
   The attribute_name_index and attribute length are read by the
   attrFactory.allocAttr method.  These values are passed into the class
   constructor.

<p>
   The constantvalue_index is the index into the constant pool
   for a long, float, double, int (for int, short, char, byte
   and boolean) or String.

   Question:

      What is the ConstantValue attribute for mondoRef, since
      its type is not a base type, but it is static.

        class mondo {
           int p, d, q;
        }
        
        class foobar {
          static mondo mondoRef = null;
          ...
        }
