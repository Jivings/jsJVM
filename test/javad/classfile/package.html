<TITLE>classfile: Java Virtual Machine Class File Package</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<p>
This package contains Java code to read and display the contents
of a Java Virtual Machine class file.  The package consists of
a single .java file, classFile.java.  This file contains Java objects
which will read and store information for the various sections
of the Java class file.  An entire class file is read by allocating
a classFile object and passing its constructor a DataInputStream
reference for the class file to be read.

<p> 
This package is part of the <i>javad</i> program which
disassembles Java class files.
